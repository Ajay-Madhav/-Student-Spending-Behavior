The dataset provided valuable insights into student spending patterns across various categories like Video Games, Indoor Games, Toys, Books, Gadgets, and more. Additionally, the Store Setting column gave us an understanding of the type of location where each store operates, which was crucial for extracting meaningful insights.</br>

## Key Features and Power BI Tools Used
Tabular Visualization: Displayed the raw data in a structured table format, providing an easy-to-read overview of student spending across different categories and store settings.</br>
Matrix Visualization: Enabled a deeper analysis of how different store locations (urban vs. rural) affect spending patterns. It helped compare categories like Toys, Books, and Video Games across various store types.</br>
Funnel Chart: Used to visualize the customer journey and spending behavior at different stages (e.g., entering a store vs. making a purchase). This helped in identifying areas where sales could be improved or customers could be better engaged.</br>
Pie Chart: Represented the proportion of total spending in each category, highlighting the most popular purchase types among students.</br>
Scatter Plot: Analyzed correlations between spending and other factors, such as store location and types of purchases. It helped identify interesting patterns, such as whether students in urban areas tend to spend more on Gadgets than those in rural areas.</br>
SandDance Plot: Added an interactive 3D visualization using SandDance to allow a more exploratory data experience. This enabled users to filter, rotate, and explore the data from multiple angles, offering new perspectives on student spending habits.
